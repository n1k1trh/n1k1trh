- 👋 Hi, I’m @n1k1trh, a high school student in Singapore.
- 👀 I'm mainly a Competitive Programmer, passionate about solving complex problems and optimizing algorithms. I enjoy deep diving into problem-solving and am constantly honing my skills across multiple coding languages. My goal is to combine my problem-solving skills with Deep Learning to create an AI model.
- 🌱 Right now, I’m diving into how to work with data and use it for machine learning. I’m learning how to manipulate data and apply it to build AI models that can recognize patterns and make decisions based on what they’ve learned. It's a goal that might seem hard, but I'm determined to get there, step by step!
- 💞️ I’m always open to collaborating on AI and Machine Learning Projects. If you're working on something exciting and want to team up, feel free to reach out.
- 📫 Contact - Drop me an email at spiderex32@gmail.com and I'll get back to you within 2-3 days 😄
