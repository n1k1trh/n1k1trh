- 👋 Hi, I’m @n1k1trh, a high school student in Singapore.
- 👀 I'm mainly a Competitive Programmer, passionate about solving complex problems and optimizing algorithms. I enjoy deep diving into problem-solving and am constantly honing my skills across multiple coding languages. My goal is to combine my problem-solving skills with Deep Learning to create an AI model.
- 🌱 I’m  currently diving into how to work with data and use it for machine learning and am learning how to manipulate data and apply it to build AI models that can recognize patterns and make decisions based on what they’ve learned.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on any project you have. If you're working on something exciting and want to team up, feel free to reach out.
